# How to run the PuMA tutorial
This folder contains notebook tutorial that show the basic workings of PuMA and pumapy. 

## Run online in Colab
You can click on the following [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/nasa/puma/blob/main/tutorial/puma_tutorial.ipynb) to run the tutorial directly on Google Colab.

## Run locally
In order to run the notebooks locally, you must have downloaded the PuMA repository to your computer. 
If you did not install from source, you will have to install the following extra dependencies into the conda environment as: 

    conda activate puma
    conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab ipympl ipyvtklink

On the other hand, if you installed puma by running "./installer.sh", then these dependencies are already part of the puma environment. 

To follow the tutorial, open a terminal and run:

    jupyter lab
    
If you installed the software using conda, then you will have to download the jupyter notebook file (puma_tutorials.ipynb) from the puma gitlab or puma github.
